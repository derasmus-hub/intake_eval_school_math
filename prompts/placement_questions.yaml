          Remote work has become increasingly popular since 2020. Many companies
          have discovered that employees can be just as productive working from home
          as they are in the office. However, some workers report feeling isolated
          and missing the social aspects of office life. Companies are now trying
          to find a balance between flexibility and team connection, with many
          adopting a hybrid model where employees work from home two or three
          days a week and come to the office for the rest.

          Children acquire language naturally through exposure, while adults tend to
          rely more on explicit grammar rules and translation. However, research shows
          that adults have some advantages: they can use their knowledge of their first
          language to understand patterns, they have better study habits, and they are
          more motivated. The key for adult learners is consistent practice and not
          being afraid to make mistakes.
        question: "According to the text, what advantage do adult learners have?"
        options:
          - "They can use their first language knowledge to find patterns"
          - "They learn faster than children"

          The phenomenon of code-switching — alternating between two or more languages
          within a single conversation — has long been viewed negatively by language
          purists. However, recent linguistic research suggests that code-switching is
          not a sign of linguistic deficiency but rather an indicator of sophisticated
          bilingual competence. Speakers who code-switch demonstrate a deep understanding
          of both languages' grammatical systems, as they must navigate complex rules
          about where switches can and cannot occur. Furthermore, code-switching serves
          important social functions: it can signal group identity, emphasize particular
          points, or fill lexical gaps where one language expresses a concept more
          precisely than the other.
        question: "What does recent research suggest about code-switching?"
        options:
          - "It indicates sophisticated bilingual ability"

          The rise of artificial intelligence in language education presents both
          opportunities and challenges. AI-powered tools can provide instant feedback
          on grammar and pronunciation, offer personalized learning paths, and make
          practice available 24/7. However, critics argue that AI cannot replicate
          the nuanced understanding of a human teacher who can read body language,
          adjust explanations in real-time based on student confusion, and provide
          the emotional support that is crucial for language learning confidence.
          The most promising approach appears to be a blended model, where AI handles

          Linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, posits that
          the structure of a language affects its speakers' worldview and cognition.
          The strong version of this hypothesis — that language determines thought —
          has been largely discredited. However, the weak version — that language
          influences thought — continues to find empirical support. For instance,
          speakers of languages with mandatory grammatical gender tend to attribute
          gendered qualities to inanimate objects, and speakers of languages with
          absolute spatial reference frames (using cardinal directions instead of
