polish_english_contrastive:
  articles:
    description: "Polish has no articles (a, an, the). This is one of the most persistent errors for Polish learners."
    common_errors:
      - "Omitting articles entirely: 'I have dog' instead of 'I have a dog'"
      - "Confusing definite and indefinite: 'I saw a moon' instead of 'I saw the moon'"
      - "Overusing 'the' once learned: 'The life is beautiful'"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Start with concrete, countable nouns in context"
      - "Use Polish demonstratives (ten, ta, to) as a bridge to 'the'"
      - "Practice with picture descriptions - 'There is a cat. The cat is black.'"
      - "Focus on the concept of 'known vs unknown' information"

  prepositions:
    description: "Polish prepositions map differently to English ones. The case system in Polish handles much of what prepositions do in English."
    common_errors:
      - "'na' maps to on/at/for depending on context"
      - "'w' maps to in/at depending on context"
      - "'do' maps to to/into/for"
      - "Saying 'on the university' (na uniwersytecie) instead of 'at the university'"
      - "Saying 'in Monday' instead of 'on Monday'"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Teach prepositions in chunks/collocations, not in isolation"
      - "Create visual maps showing Polish->English preposition mappings"
      - "Practice with time expressions (in/on/at) as a group"
      - "Practice with place expressions (in/on/at) as a separate group"

  word_order:
    description: "Polish has relatively free word order due to its case system. English requires strict SVO order."
    common_errors:
      - "Placing adverbs incorrectly: 'I always am happy' instead of 'I am always happy'"
      - "Inverted word order in statements: 'Very much I like it'"
      - "Adjective placement after noun: 'car red' instead of 'red car'"
      - "Question formation without do/does: 'You like coffee?' instead of 'Do you like coffee?'"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Drill SVO pattern with visual sentence builders"
      - "Practice question formation with do/does/did explicitly"
      - "Use colored blocks for sentence parts (subject=blue, verb=red, object=green)"

  pronunciation:
    description: "Several English sounds don't exist in Polish phonology."
    common_errors:
      - "'th' sounds /θ/ and /ð/ - often replaced with /f/, /t/, or /d/: 'fink' for 'think', 'dis' for 'this'"
      - "w/v confusion: Polish 'w' is pronounced /v/, leading to 'wery' for 'very'"
      - "Vowel length not distinguished: Polish doesn't differentiate long/short vowels"
      - "Word stress: Polish stress is almost always penultimate, English stress varies"
      - "Silent letters: 'knife', 'psychology' - Polish is more phonetic"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Mirror exercises for 'th' - tongue placement between teeth"
      - "Minimal pair drills: thin/fin, three/free, vine/wine, vet/wet"
      - "Record and playback exercises"
      - "Stress marking in vocabulary lists"

  tenses:
    description: "Polish uses a simpler tense system based on aspect (perfective/imperfective) rather than English's 12 tense-aspect combinations."
    common_errors:
      - "Confusing present simple and present continuous: 'I am go to school every day'"
      - "Avoiding present perfect entirely: 'I lived here for 5 years' instead of 'I have lived here for 5 years'"
      - "Overusing simple past where present perfect is needed"
      - "Difficulty with future forms: will vs going to vs present continuous for future"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Start with clear timelines - visual representation of when tenses apply"
      - "Contrast Polish aspect with English tense-aspect: imperfective ≈ continuous, perfective ≈ simple/perfect"
      - "Use signal words (always, right now, since, for, yet, already)"
      - "Build from present simple → present continuous → past simple → present perfect"

  false_friends:
    description: "Words that look similar in Polish and English but have different meanings."

        note: "This one actually matches but students doubt it"
      - polish: "ordynarny"

    teaching_strategies:
      - "Create flashcard sets specifically for false friends"

      - "Practice with gap-fill and sentence completion"

  phrasal_verbs:
    description: "Polish doesn't have phrasal verbs. The concept of a verb changing meaning with a particle is foreign."
    common_errors:
      - "Avoiding phrasal verbs entirely, using formal Latin-origin words instead"
      - "Separable vs inseparable confusion: 'look up it' instead of 'look it up'"
      - "Using wrong particle: 'look at' instead of 'look for'"
    teaching_strategies:
      - "Teach in context, not as lists"
      - "Group by particle (up/down/out/in) to show patterns"
      - "Group by base verb (look up, look for, look after, look into)"
      - "Use visual imagery to link particle meaning to spatial concepts"
      - "Start with the 20 most common phrasal verbs"
